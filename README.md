# SMP
The SMP is a plugin used by EMREX clients to facilitate that exchange of results between institutions. The SMP can be installed into your web site.
Installation guides will come as the project progress.

To run the SMP plugin, you can either use "mvn jetty:run" or deploy to an app server.

You must set the system property "emrex.emreg_url" which will point to the URL of EMREG.

Check the technical documentation at http://emrex.eu for details on usage of the SMP and location of EMREG.

The SMP is licensed under the EUPL, Version 1.1 or â€“ as soon they will be approved by the European Commission - subsequent versions of the EUPL.
You may obtain a copy of the Licence at https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/eupl.
